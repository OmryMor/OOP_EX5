The first main regex we used is: 
VAR_VALUE_REGEX =
"([-+]?[\\d]*[.]?[\\d]+|[\"].*[\"]|['].[']|true|false|([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*|_[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_]*))"

This regex represents values you can assign to if\while statements, variable assignment and method calling.

[-+]?[\d]*[.]?[\d]+ | 					//a double (and int) that can start with -+ and have a decimal point
                                        between the digits or at the start
[\"].*[\"] |						    //a string between two quotes
['].['] | 					           	//a single char between two apostrophe
true|false |                            //true or false keywords
([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*|_[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_]*))  //a variable name that starts with a letter or an
                                                    //underscore and can have letters, numbers and underscores
                                                    //as the exercise requires


The second main regex we used is:
VAR_TYPE_REGEX = "(final\s+)?(int|double|String|boolean|char)\s+"
This regex represents the types you can assign to variables in the exercise.

(final\s+)?                             //optional final keyword followed by a space
(int|double|String|boolean|char)\s+     //one of the types int, double, String, boolean
                                        //or char followed by a space
